      <h2>About Deryck Hodge</h2>

      <p>I'm a web developer working in media, entertainment, and
      publishing. I try to think deeply about how technology impacts
      creativity and then build software to enable storytellers to do
      their best work. I'm based in Atlanta, GA.</p>

      <p>Professionally, I'm a senior engineering manager at
      <a href="https://www.wbd.com/">Warner Bros. Discovery</a> leading the
      Tooling, Infrastructure, and Performance teams within
      <a href="https://www.cnn.com/">CNN</a> Content Platforms.
      Previous stops include: Apple, Disney, AWS, Canonical, and the
      Washington Post, among others.</p>

      <p>Full details on my professional career are available on
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deryckhodge/">my LinkedIn
      profile.</a></p>

      <p>It's fun to say I’ve been figuring out how best to tell stories
      using the web since 1998. I went to school for English and
      imagined I would be a writer and a teacher, but then I discovered
      the web. I started trying to figure out how to share my writing
      online and then got into open source software development. I found
      <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>
      and then <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>,
      and I followed Django into building on the web for news sites.
      From there, my career took off.</p>

      <p>I'm also a fan of media and entertainment outside of work. I
      love going to see movies in a theater, and I also have a nice home
      entertainment system. I'm a fan of comic books and reading
      fiction, especially literary fiction. I also love great music,
      games, sports, and travelling with my family.</p>
